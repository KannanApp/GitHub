*forch Push:
	-> The --force flag is used to forcefully update a remote branch 
with your local chnages.
	git push --force origin brance_name


*lease Push:
	-> The force with lease flag is a safer alternative to '--force' 
when pushing changes to a remote branch. It checks if the remote brance 
HEAD matches in local branch HEAD before pushing, it will help to prevent
accidental data loss.
	git push --force-with-lease origin branch_name
